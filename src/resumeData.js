  aboutme:
    "	I am a web developer based out of San Diego, California, able to create a web presence from the ground up â€” from conception to strategic planning, implementation, proper navigation, and programming to optimally improve Ux. I aim towards writing efficient, readable, and testable code while using the current best practices in web development. My optimistic and innovative mindset inevitably has driven me towards a passion for problem solving and creativity, as well as an array of other strengths such as being determined, persistent, hard working, a fast learner, and a team player proficient of a variety of scripting languages and frameworks. My knowledge extends past the scope of web development. Graduating from the University of San Diego, California (UCSD) with a BA degree in Communications, I understand the importance of effective interpersonal communication and its correlation within the tech-industry in regards of working with teams and other Web developers.",
